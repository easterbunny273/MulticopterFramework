This is a modified opengl-example "cube" from Qt5.2 documentation. It is a quick&dirty demo to 
read a rotation quaternion from a serial interface (which is written by the arduino) and render 
a cube rotated by this quaternion.

##################

To compile/run/modify the demo, "cube.pro" can be opened using "QtCreator".
(Qt 5.2 is necessary)

##################

To define from which serial interface the data should be read, modify
"ReaderThread.h".
